#summary Turnigy V2 Firmware Backup

= Turnigy V2 Firmware Backup =

Having originally managed to lose my factory Turnigy 9X V2 firmware, I eventually purchased another unit and this time took a full backup and copied it up to the Wiki

[http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/TurnigyV2.attach/Turnigy9X_V2.zip Turnigy9X_2.zip] contains all the `.bin` files.
