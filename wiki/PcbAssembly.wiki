#summary Building Your Own gruvin9x PC Board

= Building Your Own G9X PC Board =

== Preliminary Information ==

This page has been thrown together quickly to help you get started. The information is probably not well laid out and also incomplete in places.

== Where to get your PCB ==

The V4.1 PCB is now available for purchase at [http://gruvin9x.com].

== Where to get the parts ==

In short, DigiKey or Farnell (element14.com, outside the UK). If you're in the UK, Farnell is probably the cheaper choice (free shipping for online orders.) Everywhere else will probably have better luck with DigiKey.

For parts details, please see the three BOM (bill of materials) files at [http://code.google.com/p/gruvin9x/source/browse/#svn%2Farchive%2Fpcb-v4.1a-frozen archive/pcb-v4.1a-frozen]. (If you're using just a web browser, you'll need to use the "View raw file" link, found at the lower right of the page, after clicking a BOM file link, to download the Excel spreadsheet file.)

The BOM files are Excel spreadsheet format. You can view them in Open Office or using Google Docs.


== Construction Advice ==

Be sure to watch these two videos, showing how to almost effortlessly solder tiny SMD parts ...

There's also a very nicely made [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NN7UGWYmBY video by Curious Inventor] over at YouTube. The techniques are roughly the same. But some additional options and informational gems are offered.

There is a silk-screen PDF for the main V4.1 board, to use as a parts placement guide here ... [http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/archive/pcb-v4.1a-frozen/assembly/gruvin9x-SilkS_Front.pdf gruvin9x-SilkS_Front.pdf]
