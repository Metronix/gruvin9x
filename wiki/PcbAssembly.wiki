#summary Building Your Own gruvin9x PC Board

= Introduction =

With more people beginning to show an interest in assembling (soldering) their own PC boards, I thought I'd start a wiki page on the topic.

Cam (in the UK) has graciously made some videos of his soldering techniques, using a standard iron, which I will here and now formally endorse as the official, 'gruvin9x way'. :-P

For now, since a picture tells a thousand words and a video streams picture at 15+ frames per second, here are the links to Cam's two videos ...

Thanks Cam!
