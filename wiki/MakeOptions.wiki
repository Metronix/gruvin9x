#summary Custom and Default 'make' directive documentation

= Make Options (gruvin9x) =

*ER9X.C/H FILENAME CHANGE NOTICE* -- As of gruvin9x revision 179, all occurrences or 'er9x' have been changed to 'gruvin9x'. I had planned to leave er9x in place, as I figured it did no harm. But things started getting too confusing when switching between versions. I ended up accidentally editing the wrong file in the wrong directory. So it is done. 

== Defaults ==

By default, simply running 'make' from the `src/` directory will build an gruvin9x.hex in the configuration preferred by Gruvin -- this project's owner. As of revision 6, running `make` with no arguments is equivalent to ...

{{{
make EXT=FRSKY KEYRPT=DELAY BEEPER=SPEAKER
}}}

The Makefile also defaults to the 'usbtiny' AVR programmer type.

== Available Build Directives ==

<ul>
<li>EXT=

Values: STD, FRSKY (default), JETI

</li>
<li>KEYRPT=

Values: STD, DELAY (default)

</li>
<li>BEEPER=

Values: BUZZER, SPEAKER (default)

</li>
</ul>

== Standard TH/ER9X Make Commands ==

All other standard ER9X make commands remain present. Examples include ...

<blockquote><pre>*make wflash* [[PROGRAMMER=usbtiny]] - programs/flashes the ATmega64A using er9x.hex. (With optional programmer type override in [[brackets]] if not 'usbtiny')

*make reeprom TARGET=models* - reads the ATmega64A EEPROM (models/settings) data into models.bin

*make weeprom TARGET=models* - writes models.bin to the ATmega64A EEPROM, restoring models/settings

etc</pre></blockquote>
