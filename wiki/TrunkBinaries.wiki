#summary Binaries for download from the trunk/stable repository

= Latest Stable Pre-Compiled Binaries (version 'base') =

The latest, stable public maintenance release of gruvin9x firmware is code-named 'base' and lives at [http://code.google.com/p/gruvin9x/source/browse/#svn%2Fbranches%2Fbase /branches/base].

NOTE: As of this writing, the long awaited 'frsky' version has still not been tested stable enough for public release. The 'base' version is quite old and does not include any Fr-Sky telemetry support. However, it known to be stable.

There are four versions of binary .hex files you can download for flashing your '9X, without needing to compile from source.

These versions carry the latest stable bug-fixes and new features. Each file relates to one of the four different hardware modification combinations. Download the one that matches what you've done to your 9X. :D
