Here are some annotated photos of various '9X hardware components to assist with part identification, PCB replication, LCD replacement, etc.

Note: Some of the images are fairly high resolution on purpose.

== LCD Screen ==
I do not know the controller chip for the LCD screen off the top of my head. There may be a comment in the source code and/or in the various forums/discussion groups.

I've not personally owned a V1 '9X, but apparently the V2 changed from a 5V LCD screen to a 3.3V version. An additional 3.3V regulator and a bunch of voltage-divider resistors are used to interface this to the 5V ATmega64A MCU.

== Connectors ==

== Inside ==

Inside the front section of the cabinet (main PCB removed).

== Main PCB ==

My '9X is a Turnigy 9X from HobbyKing.com. This is the "V2" version. Note the additional 3.3V regulator and bunch of resistors above the ATmega64A MCU for driving the new 3.3V LCD screen.

=== Top ===
This is after a number of mods I've made to free up both ATmega64A USART ports. 

NOTE: These images are fairly high resolution -- Right-Click, View Image (or save) to see full size.

(The strange looking coil of wire on a white former (lower left) is simply wire storage for later when I have something to connect them to.)

=== Bottom ===
I removed the LCD screen's foam packer to reveal all the traces. (Hi-res.)
