*gProg* v1.1 Preview

*gprog* is a freely published part of our open hardware project. It is based on the popular [http://www.fischl.de/usbasp/ USBasp open source project]. This AVR programmer board is designed to be used with [http://companion9x.googlecode.com companion9x] or any other AVRDUDE compatible system. With it, you can upload and download EEPROM stored model data as well as perform firmware upgrades. The device is designed for the [PCB G9X v4.1 custom controller board], but could also be used as a generic AVR flash programmer.

You can build your own gprog or buy one from our online store ...

*Coming Soon* to the [http://gruvin9x.com/ gruvin9x online store]

The stand-off shown in the above image is 10.5mm in length -- PVC 2.5mm I.D. tubing, available from most model shops. The machine screw is an M2x16mm. A 2mm self-tapping screw, similar to the ones used elsewhere in the radio (but longer) would be preferable. But as yet, a source has not been found.
