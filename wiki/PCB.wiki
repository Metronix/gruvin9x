== Why? ==

The primary intention is provide a more powerful and flexible hardware platform for the TH/ER/gruvin9x open source firmware to run on -- because we can :p. The design is "open", so you can follow its progress as well as make requests and suggestions for additions and improvements -- or, of course, get involved more directly and do those for yourself.

Initial intentions are to ...

 * provide a programming header capable of supporting an onboard USB programming board (later). 
 * add RS-232 and TTL level telemetry serial data ports
 * free up most of PORTB for use with an MM/SD card interface

Many more ideas are swimming around in the author's mind and several suggestions have already come in from others. Just how far this design will go is of course a mystery at this time.

== License ==

This logic board PCB design is licensed under the [http://www.tapr.org/TAPR_Open_Hardware_License_v1.0.txt TAPR Open Hardware License v1.0]. The license is very similar to the GPL of this project's related firmware source code, but includes additional protection against the likes of what this author might term, 'hostile patent acts'. In other words, like the GPL license for software source code, the TAPR Open Hardware License seeks to ensure that the openness of this particular design shall endure. The license is NOT a non-commercial license. This design _is_ able to be used by licensees for commercial purposes, under the terms of the OHL license.

== Progress ==

As a starting point, a PCB design was worked up from scratch in [http://kicad.sourceforge.net/ KiCAD] to closely replicate the wiring and functions of Turnigy V2 '9X logic board. See [http://code.google.com/p/gruvin9x/source/browse/#svn/trunk/pcb/original /trunk/pcb/original/] (as of r155). From there, numerous changes and additions were made -- and continue to be made, as version progress.

*Past Milestones in descending date order ...*

2010-12-30: Components and PCBs have arrived (ahead of schedule). Have ordered components to make up the 'plug' end of the 2-way, 3-way and 8-way JST sockets, which I had thought were included with same. I'm elated to report that the PCB mounting holes and push-button-switch physical locations are within spec and fit well into the actual radio '9X cabinet. (That had been one of my greater concerns during the design process.)

2010-12-22: [http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pcb/rev2.14-frozen/production/gruvin9x-bom.xls  Components] to build three prototypes ordered from Digikey.com

2010-12-15: A first batch of 10 (MOQ) prototype PCB's ([http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pcb/rev2.14-frozen rev2.14]) ordered.

2010-12-02: A final draft of the PCB based on [http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pcb/rev2.1/gruvin9x_rev21.pdf schematic rev2.1] has been completed. (All files updated in `/trunk/pcb` as at r159). I'm waiting on some peer review and comments before committing this to a manufacturer. Time frame unknown.

The board includes the total re-wire of all trim and button switches into a 4x4 scanned matrix to free up most of Port B. This gives us dedicated I/O ports for the MMC/SDCARD and a couple spares as well -- with theoretically only very minor CPU load for scanning the inputs. 

The connector for the MMC/SDCARD interface can be seen at lower/middle of the image below. The two connectors to the lower right are the TTL and RS-232 level telemetry TX/RX ports. A 2-pin connector on the upper edge is for the left-hand and right-hand trim switch 'common' connections. These replace their respective connections to ground, in order to work with the new 4x4 input matrix.

This new main board will receive an *ATmega2561* (256K Flash, 4K EEPROM, 8K SRAM). I have thus far decided to keep ATmega running at 5V, though it's certainly tempting to move down to 3.3V, since the LCD screen and SDCARD currently need a total of 31 resistors just to down-convert the voltage! However, I'm concerned about possible noise increase on the ADC inputs, should the operating voltage be lowered, and a couple of other minor issues too. So at 5 Volts we stay.

NOTE: Since moved on to rev2.11 with a few minor changes/additions, like RF decoupling caps on the KEYXn inputs and some tidying up here and there. Work continues! :-D

=== Cost ===

The present best quote for low volume PCB manufacture is around the USD$15 mark -- for one of 10 boards with no components installed. Manufacturing of a prototype board will likely not happen until at least the telemetry and mass storage mods have been done. That will include break-outs for any remaining spare port pins and should get the hardware to a point where nothing additional is needed.
