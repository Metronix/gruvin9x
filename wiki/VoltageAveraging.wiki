#summary Battery voltage averaging. (Losing the jitters.)
= Why =

Whilst my own Lithium-Ion powered '9X seems fairly stable when taking ADC samples of battery voltage, I've come across several that have considerably more 'jitter' -- especially when powered by relatively high internal resistance cells, like alkaline AA-8-packs for example. 

This results in the battery voltage flickering up and down significantly -- in one example, between 8.8V and 9.4V, when a fluke multimeter sat on a steady 9.2V. 

Apart from the displeasing visual effect this has for the user, it can also cause annoying intermittent and false low-bat alarms. Not so good.

= The Fix =

Implemented a simple running average -- `new_value = (last_value * 9 + new_sample) / 10`. 

The use of 9 'virtual' last values vaguely simulates recording of 9 previous samples and slows down the response to rapidly changing samples -- but is not _too_ slow. This effectively eliminates 'the jitters', where unstable battery voltage samples are occurring, for whatever reason.

== Make Options ==

None. The option to turn this feature off using a `Make` directive was removed some time around r200. Why? Because too many `Make` directives was getting messy and I felt this feature was of benefit to everyone.
