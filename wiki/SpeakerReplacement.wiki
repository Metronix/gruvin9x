#summary Why I replaced the stock beeper with a speaker

= Replacing the Stock Beeper with a Speaker =

== Why? ==

One could easily wonder why beeps and buzzes are so important that I had to write a bunch of code and change my hardware for it. Well, let me explain my motives ...

<img src="http://www.mountainflying.com/Pages/articles/images/LRI.jpg" align="right" width="160"> Aside from replicating features found on other brand radios, such as low/mid/high point trim tones and the like, the one thing I have always most wanted from telemetry is an AoA ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_attack Angle of Attack]) instrument. What's an AoA instrument? ... Well in short, it's used to assist in landing and as I understand it, is usually calibrated as a Lift Reserve Indicator or LRI. 

AoA or LRI is an analogue feedback device, intended to be superior to the basic stall warning. Many argue that's it's completely redundant and that we've got along fine for years without it. However, I'm not one of them and this project is not about full-size air craft anyway.

Now, I am perfectly capable of putting most any plane down like a feather just visually from my years of experience to date. And I no longer care much for stall warning switches or airspeed indication, as I've come to doubt such would really help much in practice, if at all. Never the less, at this stage, I still believe that appropriately configured audio LRI feedback could be at least reassuring, if not fun. It should not even need calibration, really, since our ears and brain will remember what sounds 'about right' at the point of minimum lift and for any given model, after a just a few landings, I'm sure.

== How? ==

Some kind of AoA sensor will be added to an available model plane, in at tleast the 40-size category. Fr-Sky telemetry will be used to send data back to my custom '9X radio.

What I plan is to use varying pitch tones, similar to the sensitive rise/sink tone generators in modern sail planes. Sink comes across as a constant, relatively low tone, falling more in pitch as the sink is greater. Rise is an intermittent "bip bip bip" tone, rising in pitch and frequency as lift increases. The sounds are very intuitive and allow you to know exactly what's going on without staring at an instrument panel. Of course, my tones will be indicating relative angle-of-attack or lift reserve, not rise/sink.

With that, and a suitably functional AoA sensor on my aircraft (and that's a whole other story!) ... I should be able to gauge the an appropriate landing approach for the plane. Any sudden turbulence should result in the tones going a little crazy... but my own eyes and brain should realise that far quicker I should think. Still, that aspect may also be interesting and perhaps even of some use.

Now, if you fly on a relatively flat chunk of land somewhere, you might be wondering what this is really all about. Well, I/we don't have such luxuries around here. One of the fields (especially) that I frequent is located in an undulated area of varying ground types, including water. One experiences a multitude of essentially unpredictable lift, sink, rotor and general turbulence on final approach, which changes in characteristic as the day wares on. We cope with it all perfectly well without fancy AoA gadgets of course, but I've already covered that angle, above.

Now I don't know if in practice any LRI feedback system of my own design will be rapid or responsive enough, or even help much at all for that matter. But I do want to find out. Will it make my landings any better and will anyone else even care? Well, maybe not. But I'm going to have fun making it all happen. That much is certain.


== Speaker Installation ==

Below is an image showing the first ugly speaker install I did. Hey! It works mmmkay? :-P Later I'll probably add some resistor and another capacitor or two to smooth out the square wave for a nicer tone.
