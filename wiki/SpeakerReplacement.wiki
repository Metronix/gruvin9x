#summary Why I replaced the stock beeper with a speaker

= Replacing the Stock Beeper with a Speaker =

== Why? ==

One could easily wonder why beeps and buzzes are so important that I had to write a bunch of code and change my hardware for it. Well, let me explain my motives ...

<img src="http://www.mountainflying.com/Pages/articles/images/LRI.jpg" align="right" width="160">The one thing I have always most wanted from telemetry is an AoA ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_attack Angle of Attack]) instrument. What's an AoA instrument? ... Well in short, it's used to assist in landing and as I understand it, is usually calibrated as a Lift Reserve Indicator or LRI. 

Now, I'm perfectly capable of putting most any plane down like a feather just through my flying experience to date. However, the job would still be easier, and perhaps more fun, if I had tones in my ear telling of my relative AoA.

AoA is a variable, analogue measuring device, intended to be superior to the basic stall warning. Many argue that's it's completely redundant and that we've got along fine for years without it. However, I'm not one of them and this is not about full-size air craft anyway.

== How? ==

What I plan is to use varying pitch tones like the rise/sink tone generators in modern sail planes. Sink comes across as a constant, relatively low tone, falling more in pitch as the sink is greater. Rise is an intermittent "bip bip bip" tone, rising in pitch and frequency as lift increases. It's very intuitive and allows you to know exactly what's going on without staring at an instrument panel. (In this case, a series of fast, high-pitched "bips" will tell me I'm about to stall.)

With that, and a suitably functional AoA sensor on my aircraft (that's a whole other story!) ... I'll be able to gauge the precise approach speed for the plane -- and even get warning if there's a sudden decrease in air speed due to a shift in the wind.

Will it make my landings any better and will anyone else even care? Well, maybe not. But I'm going to have fun making it all happen. That much is for sure.

(Incidentally, this is all clearly more useful on larger, heavier nitro planes than light weight, small electrics. I certainly wouldn't bother sticking it on my foamie EDF jet! There's just be no fun in that at all.)

Here's an image showing the ugly install I did. Hey! It works mmmkay? :-P
