We're working hard to make the v4 board available in completed form. Time and especially budgets are against us. Please be patient or, better still, go win a lottery near you and then come sponsor our efforts. :-)


*IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER NOTICE*

Whatever happens, please be aware that this is a tiny group of hobbyists sharing their work for free. We are NOT a business group developing a product for mass production, with advertising budgets or formal after-sales support or anything of that nature. Anything you may buy from us is purchased strictly at your own risk with no warranties expressed or implied -- unless otherwise stated at the time of sale. We simply cannot accept any financial responsibility what-so-ever. However, with the best of intentions in mind, we do pledge to do whatever we reasonably can at any given time to help solve any issues you may encounter, all at our sole discretion of course.
