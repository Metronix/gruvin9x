Why [http://www.frsky-rc.com/ Fr-Sky]? Well, local tests have shown the brand to be very reliable, robust and functional to date -- not to mention that it's competitively priced and the working protocols are freely published by the manufacturer, making it a perfect match for an open source project.

So far I've implemented rudimentary receiver battery voltage display on the pre-existing FRSKY menu, accessed by pressing [[DOWN LONG]] (assuming you've made the FRSKY/JETI hardware mods and compiled your firmware appropriately.)

Here's how it looks ...

The frequency of voltage bar display updates is considerably faster than I expected. To the eye, it looks near instantaneous, which is great!

In this particular case, the receiver is running from a 4n alkaline 4-cell pack on the test bench. As a side not, it's interesting to see how the relatively high internal resistance of such batteries allow the receiver voltage to significantly dip when moving three servos about (under no load).
