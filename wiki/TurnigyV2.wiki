= The Turnigy 9X =
_Also marketed under brand names: Eurgle, iMax, FlySky and others_


== Reference Images == 
Some [ReferenceImages reference images] of the internals of the '9X hardware are posted [ReferenceImages here] for convenient reference. (It saves opening up the case every time we need to check some minor detail.)

== Circuit Schematics ==

A TH/ER9X project contributor(?) provided PDF circuit schematics of the V1(?) stock transmitter and receiver. You can find this [http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/9X_Schematic.pdf here]. 

The V2 circuitry is almost identical, except it has a new 3.3V LCD display plus supporting components. [Circuitry More information], including a [http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pcb/actual_v2_9x/gruvin9x_v2_actual.pdf new V2 schematic] for the V2 hardware is [Circuitry here].

Hacking the '9X circuit board with hair-fine wires and hot glue is fun, but can be tedious and risks damage. 

What if we had a whole new replacement PCB with connectors for two-way telemetry data and MMC/SDCard for mass storage etc designed right in? Once again crossing that fine line between hobby and insanity, such a design and subsequent production is under way.

(The first prototype PCB batch was ordered from the manufacturer 2010-12-15)

See [PCB here] for details, including related, new circuit schematics.

= Turnigy V2 Firmware Backup =

Having originally managed to lose my factory Turnigy 9X V2 firmware, I eventually purchased another unit and this time took a full backup and copied it up to the wiki

[http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/TurnigyV2.attach/Turnigy9X_V2.zip Turnigy9X_2.zip] contains all the `.bin` files from said backup.

Or you can browse the individual files at [http://code.google.com/p/gruvin9x/source/browse/#svn/wiki/TurnigyV2.attach].
