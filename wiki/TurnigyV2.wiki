= The Turnigy 9X =
_Also marketed under brand names: Eurgle, iMax, FlySky and others_

== Reference Images ==

Some [ReferenceImages reference images] of the internals of the '9X hardware are posted [ReferenceImages here] for convenient reference. (It saves opening up the case every time we need to check some minor detail.)

== Custom Main Board ==

Hacking the '9X circuit board with hair fine wires and hot glue is fun, but can be tedious and risks damage. What if we had a whole new replacement PCB with features for telemetry and SDCards etc designed right in? Once again crossing that fine line between hobby and insanity,such a design and subsequent production is under way. 

See [PCB here] for details.

= Turnigy V2 Firmware Backup =

Having originally managed to lose my factory Turnigy 9X V2 firmware, I eventually purchased another unit and this time took a full backup and copied it up to the wiki

[http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/TurnigyV2.attach/Turnigy9X_V2.zip Turnigy9X_2.zip] contains all the `.bin` files from said backup.

Or you can browse the individual files at [http://code.google.com/p/gruvin9x/source/browse/#svn/wiki/TurnigyV2.attach].
