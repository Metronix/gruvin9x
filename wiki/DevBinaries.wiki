#summary Development Binaries No Longer Available

== Development Binaries No Longer Produced ==
Since the public release of the first fully tested gruvin9x firmware was made in December, 2011, we are not longer building development binaries for direct download. This is partly to try and prevent accidents occurring from the use of incomplete, potentially buggy software and partly because we simply see no point in doing so.

== Follow the Latest via Source Code ==
We encourage those interested in following our latest developments (mostly for the v4.1 or later custom controller boards and accessories) to check out the project source code, as described at the "Source" menu link, above.

== DO NOT FLY with development code ==
PLEASE do not fly with development code unless you truly know what you are doing and without being very careful to ground test all functions thoroughly before flight. ASSUME NOTHING -- *SAFETY FIRST*!

(The same advice also goes for the stable public release -- *SAFETY FIRST*. But it's especially important for development code. PLEASE be very, very careful, as we will accept no responsibility for any use of this code, what-so-ever.)
