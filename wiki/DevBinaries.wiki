#summary Release Candidate Binaries for version 'frisky'

= Frisky Release Candidate Binaries (.HEX files) =

The next stable release of gruvin9x firmware has been dubbed, 'frisky' (though still spelled 'frsky'). It is the long awaited, stable release of our new code, which started out with the simple goal of adding Fr-Sky telemetry features, but ended up with a lot more besides.

*SERIOUS BUGS MAY EXIST*

Serious bugs can exist in this pre-release version at any time, without warning. You MUST exercise extreme caution by thoroughly testing air craft, restrained and on the ground before committing to flight. Of course, you do so entirely at your own risk.


=== Version Information ===
[http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/branches/frsky/svnversion.gif]

== UNSTABLE Pre-Release Snapshot Binary .hex Download Links ==

There are five versions of pre-compiled binary .hex files you can download for flashing your '9X without needing to compile from source. 

Each version pertains to the various combinations of hardware modifications that you may or may not have performed on the target '9X radio.

*DOWNLOADING*: You may need to "right-click, save target/link as ..." to save these files to local disk.

=== Factory Original PC Board Based Versions ===
 * *[http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/branches/frsky/gruvin9x-stock.hex gruvin9x-stock.hex]* -- For stock hardware (no internal re-wiring) -- includes the keypad auto-repeat and bat. voltage averaging patches, nicer fonts and much more.

 * *[http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/branches/frsky/gruvin9x-std-speaker.hex gruvin9x-std-speaker.hex]* -- For [SpeakerReplacement speaker upgrade] only. No Fr-Sky wiring mods.

 * *[http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/branches/frsky/gruvin9x-frsky-nospeaker.hex gruvin9x-frsky-nospeaker.hex]* -- [FrskyInterfacing Fr-Sky telemetry] mod, but no speaker upgrade.

 * *[http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/branches/frsky/gruvin9x-frsky-speaker.hex gruvin9x-frsky-speaker]* -- [FrskyInterfacing Fr-Sky telemetry] and [SpeakerReplacement speaker upgrade] mods in place.

 NOTE: The _speaker_ versions will work on the stock radio with no speaker, giving softer, frequency variable tones through the standard piezo beeper/buzzer. You may prefer this to the otherwise (sometimes) ear-rattling, default beeps or squeals, depending on the nature of your particular radio.

=EEPROM FORMAT CAN CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE!=
*VERY VERY IMPORTANT!* This pre-release version can change EEPROM file format at ANY time, causing you to lose ALL settings and model data and have to re-enter everything from scratch. Also, it *does NOT work with eePe* and should not ever be expected to. Instead, please take a look at the [http://companion9x.googlecode.com companio9x project].


=== Custom PC Board Based Versions ===
 * *[http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/branches/frsky/gruvin9x.hex gruvin9x.hex]* -- *You probably _DON'T_ want this version!* -- Latest development version for custom PCB hardware. (PCB V4.1 from 2011-11-04)
