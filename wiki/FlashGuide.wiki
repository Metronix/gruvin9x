<img src="http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/FlashGuide.attach/usbpktprog.jpg" align="left">The first thing you will need is one of the many available AVR programmer kits. Perhaps you already have an AVR programmer? I purchased a [http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=9825 USB Pocket Programmer] from Spark Fun. It works really well and is not at all expensive. ([http://sparkfun.com SparkFun] have a some really cool stuff by the way. Stop by for a while and check them out!)

You'll need to connect your programmer's ICP (In-Circuit Programming) cable to your '9X. Some people have made 'pogo boards', which are fabricated as templates around existing PCB screw mounting holes to enable solder-less, temporary connection to the ATmega64A ICP programming pads on the '9X main PCB. This is done using clever spring-loaded connector pins called [http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=8870 pogo pins]. The idea is especially good for bulk re-flashing of multiple units without soiling the brand new PCB with a soldering iron. I'll only be discussing direct soldering here.

There is an excellent PDF guide for Windows users [http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/Flashing%20the%209x.pdf], which also shows how to connect an AVR programmer ribbon cable to the '9X. That guide though seems to rely on the colour coded cable to figure out which wire goes where. So I've included a photo below of my 'classic grey' ribbon cable installation, with numbered wires for your convenience.

When I ordered my SparkFun Pocket Programmer, I had them add a spare programming cable. I cut the two 'remote' connectors off the end of that and used it to wire up my radio. Long story short — here's a photo of my installation, using a stock SparkFun cable ...

  <b>IMPORTANT:</b> The picture below shows a typical ‘V2′ transmitter, as has been shipping for a few months as at time of this writing. The V1 unit  had an error on the PCB where the ‘SCK’ programming pad (wire 7 below) connected one pin too far left on the ATmega64 chip. So watch out for that! If you have a V1 unit, you can still get things going. But you’re going to have to be more careful to get a wire soldered to the right place. (Notes about this also in the linked ‘online version’ instructions below.)

*NOTE:* The two hot-glued little resistors and fine wires to the left are the re-wiring necessary to free up the ATmega64A serial comms port for telemetry data, which is otherwise connected to the Throttle-Hold and Aileron-DR switches. The switches get moved to two spare port pins. *This mod is only necessary* if you intend using the EXT=JETI or EXT=FRSKY (the default for _gruvin9x_) `make` attributes when building the source. The code will then automatically re-assign the THH and AIL switches appropriately. See [http://code.google.com/p/er9x/wiki/JETI here] for more details.

There are in fact (gruvin9x) plans to re-assign ATmega64A comms port (UART interface) for interfacing to a bulk storage SDCARD or USB Flash device in the semi-near future. The telemetry data input would then be handled by a software defined serial comms receiver, implemented on yet another spare port pin. Fortunately, there is such a pin still available, without using the pin already reserved for LCD back-light control :-D. Such a mod would no longer support outbound serial data for duplex telemtry however, so some more thought will be engaged in before proceeding down this track.

= Flashing the Firmware =

== Software ==
<img src="http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/FlashGuide.attach/avrdude.jpg" align="right"><img src="http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/FlashGuide.attach/crosspack.jpg" align="right">Whilst I'm no stranger to Windows, I strongly prefer using my Mac for all development work. Fortunately, so do many others who work with Atmel AVR chips, so there’s a nice packaged installer named [http://www.obdev.at/products/crosspack/ CrossPack] that has everything you need for cross-compiling C/C++ AVR code on your Mac. 

CrossPack also comes bundled with [http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/avrdude/ AVRDUDE], which is used to operate the programmer hardware. Even more conveniently, the 'usbtiny' programmer protocol driver that the SparkFun USB Pocket Programmer I randomly chose is also included and installed, ready-to-run as part of the CrossPack bundle. Very cool!

And yes, the above software is all free! Aint it great? Be sure to say thanks or drop a donation!

== Ready-to-Run "binary" firmware ==

There are (at the time of this writing) four pre-compiled hex file versions of gruvin9X available and kept up to date that you can download and use to flash your '9X without having to compile the source. Here are the links ...

*PLEASE NOTE* _These are snapshots of 'thought to be OK' latest builds. You should always take a backup of the last known good code you installed and keep it handy in case you need to revert_. Earlier versions can also be found in the project's `trunk/` directory using the project [http://code.google.com/p/gruvin9x/source/browse/ source browser]. (Revision navigation links are to the upper right of the browser page.)

 * [http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gruvin9x-stock.hex gruvin9x-stock.hex] -- For stock hardware (no internal re-wiring) -- includes the keypad auto-repeat and bat. voltage averaging patches.

 * [http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gruvin9x-std-speaker.hex gruvin9x-std-speaker.hex] -- For speaker upgrade only. No Fr-Sky wiring mods.

 * [http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gruvin9x-frsky-nospeaker.hex gruvin9x-frsky-nospeaker.hex] -- Fr-Sky telemetry mods but no speaker upgrade.

 * [http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gruvin9x-frsky-speaker.hex gruvin9x-frsky-speaker.hex] -- Fr-Sky telemetry and Speaker mods in place.

 * [http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gruvin9x.hex gruvin9x.hex] -- Fully 'Gruvinvized' with Fr-Sky, speaker and other 'random' gruvin9x features, such as moving LH_Trim_Up/Dwn away from USART1 to free same for secondary serial communications. (The latter mod is still experimental and little to no documentation exists for it.)


== Flashing Ready-to-Run Firmware == 
You can now burn your gruvin9x[[-version]].hex file using AVRDUDE like this ...

{{{
avrdude -c usbtiny -p atmega64 -B 1 -U flash:w:gruin9x[-version].hex
}}}

AVRDUDE should find the USB programmer, whatever port it's connected to. If not, try unplugging the programmer and plugging it back in. (You need to do this at least once after installing CrossPack. No reboots are required. This is NOT Windows! :-P )

The flash procedure will completely erase your ATmega64 chip, write in the new firmware and then read back the code to verify it all went OK. After using gruvin9x for a while, you can take a backup of your model programming data using the following AVRDUDE command ...

{{{
avrdude -c usbtiny -p atmega64 -B 1 -U eeprom:r:models.bin:r
}}}

... and restore that model data after a re-flash using ...

{{{
avrdude -c usbtiny -p atmega64 -B 1 -U eeprom:w:models.bin
}}}

Oh by the way; unless you happen to have a battery connected to the '9X, leave the tiny little switch on the programmer PCB set to “Power Target”. That will power up the 9X in a fashion it isn’t used to -- IE. switches and keypad disconnected, which it will complain bitterly about with annoying beeps. But just block your ears and ignore all the commotion. The new gruvin9x firmware will soon put a quietening end to that! 

= What to Expect =

After re-flashing for the first time, you can expect to feel a little bit anxious! Do not fret! The feeling is completely normal. :-D

Tuck your programming cable away for now in such a way that allows you to put the rear cover back on the transmitter. *REMEMBER* to reconnect the rear-cabinet cable connector! The first time I flicked the power switch after flashing I got absolutely nothing. Not even a beep or a flicker. “Uhoh!” ... then I realised the thing just wasn't going to go so well without the power being connected! :-P

During boot-up, the new firmware checks a few things. You’ll get one or more “alerts” on screen, like “Throttle not set idle” and a message about there being no alarms — meaning the beeper is turned off, as it is by default. Also, all switches have to be in the “off” state — that is, all front switches ‘up’ and top switches ‘back’. Oh and don’t worry — all these power-up warnings can be disabled through settings in the new '9X menus if you don’t want them.

Once you clear those messages away (by pressing [EXIT] for each or satisfying the switch requests), you should see the (also optional) 'ER9X splash/title screen'. (I may get even more cheeky and design my own 'gruvin9x' logo some day. :-P) And from this point, it just gets better and better.

The first thing you’ll want to do is set the ‘mode’ to ‘Mode 1′, for your throttle on the right, right? — since no one in their right mind would _ever_ use Mode 2 now, would they? :-P OK, maybe a few might. Mode 2 is in fact the default, and I haven't changed that at this stage. All these settings get backed up along with model programming data (as described above), so it's really no biggie.

Oh! To access that menu, press and hold [LEFT] (original '+') button. And on that note, now would be a really good time to give the [http://er9x.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/ER9x%20Users%20Guide.pdf ER9X Users Guide] a thorough once-over. If you haven't already, I think you'll be impressed with how powerful this firmware is. It truly does completely transform an otherwise rather average "Chinese '9X" radio into something quite fun to use and own.

= Compiling from Source =

Please see the [CompilingFromSource Compiling From Source] wiki page for details on this subject, including changes to the original Makefile defaults employed by gruvin9x.
