= Firmware / Hardware Version Map =

A map is quite useless to you if you don't know where on the map you currently are. This map is especially useless because it does not actually exist yet. Doh! :-P

What this page _will_ be, some day, hopefully, is an easy to understand, 'at a glance' guide to which firmware versions offer exactly what features -- and exactly what hardware (PCB/transmitter) versions or hacks are required for compatibility with each of those.

=== Meanwhile ... ===
In the meantime, information on this topic can be found on the [FlashGuide Flash Guide] and [MakeOptions Make Options] wiki pages -- probably in that order of usefulness to most.
