#summary SD Card / RTC Board Installation

= SD Card / RTC Board Installation =

Here's some pictures showing where Gruvin installed his SD card board -- and where it was designed to fit from the start, if that helps. :-D

|| Almost flush. Could have done better with more care. ||

|| Speaker is lowest, then SD card, then original power switch board. ||

I put tape over the button battery holder, just in case it 
shorts out on something. Probably not required.

|| The original piezo "beeper" is removed and re-soldered as shown, to make room. ||

I probably over-did the hot glue a little. :-D
