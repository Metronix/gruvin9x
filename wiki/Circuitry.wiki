= V2 Schematic =

There exists (in trunk/doc) a PDF circuit schematic, which appears to be from the version 1 radio. Here is link to a V2 schematic, which includes a couple of changes, most notable being the addition of a regulator and voltage-splitter resistor network to drive a 3.3V LCD display.

= New PCB =

A PCB design has been worked up from scratch in KiCAD to replicate the wiring and function of the V2 '9X hardware. It's closely based on the layout of the original PCB -- especially in terms of component placement. 

== Why? ==

The intention is to start from a near copy of the stock circuit (completed), then make changes to facilitate the freeing up of more I/O ports on the ATmega64, with a view to using them for telemetry data acquisition and SD/MMC card mass storage -- and possible to interface to a coffee machine. (Joking on that last bit! :-P) 

Oh and, I also intend installing an ATmega128A to double the Flash program code and EEPROM memory space. (Double the model memory capacity and enough program space to allow for the SD/MMC card FAT file system code library and all the telemetry 'dashboard' plans.)

As of this writing, this design has been completed and is the stock circuitry plus just one extra component -- a 10 pin AVR programmer header in the lower right of the board.

PCB file links etc to come when I get a little more time

NOTE: The above image is just a PhotoShop mock-up based on the various layers output from KiCAD. Present best quote for low volume PCB manufacture is around the USD$15 mark. Manufacturing of prototypes will not happen until the telemetry and mass storage wiring mods (plus a few other things perhaps) have been completed.
