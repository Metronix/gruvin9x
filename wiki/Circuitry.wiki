= Custom '9X Logic Board PCB Schematics =

The custom circuitry for Gruvin's '9X has gone through a number of evolutions, and continues to evolved. The following links show the path taken to date

Ongoing custom circuit and PCB design takes place at [http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pcb/]. There you'll find a KiCAD project file named `gruvin9x.pro`, with internal references to `gruvin9x.sch` and `gruvin9x.pcb`. (Work on the V3 board has already started.)

Gruvin's original '9X radio has been the test bed for much of the work to date, and has been chopped up and re-wired in several ways. A (generally) up to date reference schematic for that can be found at [http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pcb/hacked]. For your convenience, there's a PDF version of the schematic, http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pcb/hacked/gruvin9x-hacked.pdf here].

The first prototype 'V2' PCB design, schematic and production files as sent for PCB fabrication in December, 2010 can be found at [http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pcb/rev2.14-frozen]. For your convenience, there's a PDF version of the schematic, [http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pcb/rev2.14-frozen/gruvin9x.pdf here].
