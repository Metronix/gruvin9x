= Custom '9X Logic Board PCB Schematics =

The custom circuitry for Gruvin's '9X has gone through a number of evolutions, and continues to evolved. The following links show the path taken to date

== Ongoing Design ==
Ongoing custom circuit and PCB design takes place at [http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pcb/]. There you'll find a KiCAD project file named `gruvin9x.pro`, with internal references to [http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pcb/gruvin9x.sch gruvin9x.sch] and [http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pcb/gruvin9x.pcb gruvin9x.pcb]. (Work on the V3 board has already started.)

== First Prototype ==
The first prototype 'rev 2.14' PCB design, schematic and production files, as sent to the PCB fabrication factory in December of 2010, can be found at [http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pcb/rev2.14-frozen]. For your convenience, there's a PDF version of the schematic, [http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pcb/rev2.14-frozen/gruvin9x.pdf here].

As at September 2011, we've progressed to v4.0 and are yet to release a board for general consumption. It is our firm intention to finally do just that with v4.1, hopefully before December of the same year. Version 4.0, final prototypes are currently being assembled with a number of beta testers being lined up for the first few v4.1 production boards.

== Original 'Hacked' Radio ==
Gruvin's original '9X radio has been the test bed for much of the work to date, and has been chopped up and re-wired in several ways. A (generally) up to date reference schematic for that can be found at [http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pcb/hacked]. For your convenience, there's a PDF version of the schematic, [http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pcb/hacked/gruvin9x-hacked.pdf here].
