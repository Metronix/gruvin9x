SmartieParts.com (Steven) sells a really cool solder-less PCB that include EL backlight driver, USB programmer interface and makes all it's connections to your '9X PCB withot a drop of solder.

If you just want an inverter and EL panel to add to your already custom '9X, SmartieParts.com can sort you out there too.
