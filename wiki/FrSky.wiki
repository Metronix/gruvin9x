= Fr-Sky Two-Way Telemetry Module Support =

The gruvin9x project was born mostly out of a desire to add support for [http://www.frsky-rc.com Fr-Sky] telemetry data, including the ability to program the built-in [http://www.frsky-rc.com Fr-Sky] alarm settings.

As of `branches/frsky` r211, the above goals have been completed to a beta testing stage.

Bearing in mind that one would not typically be looking at the '9X LCD screen while actually flying a plane, for example, following is how it looks, so far ... 

== Screen Shots ==

=== The Main FRSKY Page ===
After pressing `[DOWN (LONG)]`, one is presented with the *FRSKY 1/2* menu page. 

Here, we see the page with the Fr-Sky receiver powered off and thus no telemetry data being received. In this state, a large "NO DATA" message is displayed and the last known values, for A1, A2, RSSI, RX Batt and the graphical voltage bar, blink on and off to further accentuate the fact that data in this state is out of date.

Here is the same page with the Fr-Sky receiver powered on.

=== FRSKY ALARMS ===
Pressing `[RIGHT]` takes us to the *FRSKY ALARMS 2/2 menu page.

[http://gruvin9x.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/FrSky.attach/alarms.jpg]

Here we immediately see existing alarms values, as retrieved from the Fr-Sky transmitter module. (If for some reason you want to manually reload that data, you can press `[MENU (LONG)]`)

Each field is editable. Select a field using `[UP]`, `[DOWN]`, `[LEFT]` and `[RIGHT]`. Press `[MENU]` to enter edit mode and make your selection using `[LEFT]` and `[RIGHT]`.

Pressing `[MENU]` again exits edit mode and it is at this point that the new alarm settings for that row are written out to the Fr-Sky transmitter module.

In case you're wondering, some people, for whatever reason, have difficulty remembering which '<' or '>' symbol means 'less' or 'greater than'. So I took it upon myself to add "GT" and "LT", with the idea that, '<b>G</b>reater <b>T</b>han' and, '<b>L</b>ess <b>T</b>han' might assist.

Incidentally, the ordering of the alarm settings -- with A2 above A1 -- is intentional. For some reason, the Chinese designers ordered things in this way, and it simply saves code and RAM space to not bother buffering and re-organising it. Even on the receiver casing, we see the input channels labelled 'backwards' (to the Western mind?) -- 'A2 A1', left to right. `*shrug*`

= TO DO =

A number of things need implementing and testing before this Fr-Sky support is committed to the `trunk/` version.

 * Configurable A1/A2 Voltage divider settings. I plan to implement these as 'Max Volts' / 'Calibration Offset'] pairs, where the later will be a voltage in 0.1V increments to add or subtract from the final result to adjust for component tolerances, at some chosen reference voltage. That is to say, true (linear) calibration would include a multiplier factor to stretch or compress values as required to get the voltage accurate across its entire range. But this is really a bit of over-kill for our purposes and will not be implemented. _(Completed/Testing)_

 * Fr-Sky module alarm status display and programming. _(Completed/Testing)_

 * Addition of graphical bar for signal strength
