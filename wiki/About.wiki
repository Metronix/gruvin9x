= Introduction =

This project started out as a kind of 'place holder' for the author's personal upgrades, hacks and mods to his [http://code.google.com/p/er9x/ ER9X]-powered Turnigy 9X V2 RC transmitter. As tie went on, more and more supporting documentation and other data was added, so as to keep it all in one place. Trying to keep all this information in order and up to date is, of course, an ongoing challenge. The project's name came simply from the author's long-time online nickname. 

Initial intentions were to get to know the ER9X crew, maybe becoming a contributor at some point. However, gruvin9x began to fork off in its own life quite quickly and, well, I just kept going. Eventually, a few of the other project owners and contributors got in contact to say hello, which has been very nice. I still keep a pretty low profile on the other project as I don't wish to create a stir. Besides, they're all doing just fine. It's all good stuff! :-D

= (Some) Project Details =

The main intention for gruvin9x is to provide a growing range of features and functions to support Fr-Sky telemetry natively on the '9X -- as well as mass storage using MMC and/or SD Flash cards. (The latter eventually having been relegated to a whole new, custom main board upgrade!)

The project started off with a few relatively minor tweaks to ER9X, as it was at the time.

Way back at revision 46 (r46), better key-repeat delays and a hack to get variable frequency tones through a speaker, instead of the single-pitch 'beeper' of the stock unit, were implemented.

The latter resulted in low/mid/higher pitch key and trim button beeps. But its long term intention was to provide a greater range of unique sounds for eyes-off telemetry data. See [SpeakerReplacement Why I replaced the stock beeper with a speaker] for details.

When I flashed a local RC modeller's stock radio with gruvin9x the first time, there were problems with the stock 8-pack-of-alkaline cells causing a lot of jitter in the battery voltage display. Since then, gruvin9x has had a running0-average stabiliser to fix that.

After a while, TH's original coding and method started to become familiar. (Thomas is something of a genus C++ programmer IMHO too by the way!) So I started delving more into menus, custom settings and the like in support of Fr-Sky two-way telemetry. See [FrSky here] for details of progress on that score.

== RCModelReviews.com Telemetry Hub Support ==

Plans exist to support the [http://www.rcmodelreviews.com/frsky_telemetry_project.shtml RCModelReviews (RCMR) Telemetry Hub], once it is ready for public release. The basic goal here will be to duplicate the functions of the stand-alone 'dashboard' partner for the hub, inside the 9X, using it's own display, user interface, etc.


= Bigger Plans - A Whole New Main Board =

There are a number of somewhat challenging '9X hardware wiring modifications required just to get access to telemetry data. That alone is not too bad -- but we also want access to more of the IO pins currently (lazily) spread out over nearly all the higher function ports of the host ATmega64A chip. Most notably for the purposes of gruvin9x goals, dedicated access to MOSI/MISO/SCK (on Port B) for SPI mode data transfer to/from an MMC/SDCARD is needed.

These and other requirements led to a state of temporary insanity and the commencing of a complete re-work of the entire main board PCB! A near duplicate of the stock PCB was first worked up, then changes and additions were added. Find details on the [PCB] wiki page.

= Contacting Gruvin =

Oops! As of this writing, I've discovered that the Google Code system for obtaining project owner email addresses is broken. Hopefully, Google will fix this very soon. Meanwhile, fear not ...

Normally, you would visit my Google Projects user profile, then click the '...' in `gru...@gmail.com` to reveal the full address, after [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA captcha] verification. On the other hand, if you're _very_ clever, you might just be able to work that out for yourself. *Hint* My user alias is `gruvin`, not `gru...` ;-)

*HOWEVER*, I'd really like you to please consider joining the [http://groups.google.com/group/gruvin9x-discuss gruvin9x discussion group] and communicating with the group there -- unless it's a personal matter, of course. Thanks :-D
