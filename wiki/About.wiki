= Introduction =

This project started out as a kind of 'place holder' for the author's personal upgrades, hacks and mods to his [http://code.google.com/p/er9x/ ER9X]-powered Turnigy 9X V2 RC transmitter. 

The project's name come simply from the author's long-time online nickname. Initial intentions were to get to know the ER9X crew, maybe becoming a contributor at some point. However, gruvin9x began to fork off in its own life quite quickly.

At the same time, the author was becoming more aware of the overall power of the Google Code concept. Now, since comparing the differences between all flavours of this code is made so open and easy, it allows us to glean ideas from each other, picking and choosing what we want in our custom versions -- as well as allowing end users to comment and influence those choices. 

Whilst all this may well forge the proverbial two-edged sword — by producing 'too many' versions — the simple delight of working directly on such a project as, when and how the author feels like it is just to much temptation to pass up.

= Details =

The main intention for gruvin9x is to provide a growing range of features and functions to support Fr-Sky telemetry natively on the '9X.

As of revision 46 (r46), the following three features have been added ...

*Feature 1 -- Key-repeat delay* (optional)

The stock ER9X/TH9X code does not implement a delay between a menu button press and when that button starts auto-repeating. This can result in skipping desired desired settings. 

*Feature 2 -- Buzzer replaced with Speaker for variable pitch tones etc* (optional)

Apart from the fact that the stock '9X 'beeper' (in some batches especially) is incredibly upsetting to the ear ... useful telemetry feedback while actually flying a model aircraft necessitates the use of something other than visual readout on an LCD display. An intuitive array of various sounds, including short melodies, rising and falling pitch and what not seems the obvious, simple choice. 

Low/mid/higher pitch key and trim button beeps (values <0, 0 and >0 respectively) have already been implemented. Work on telemetry tones will commence once the hardware is available — very soon in theory.

See [SpeakerReplacement Why I replaced the stock beeper with a speaker] for more detail.

*Feature 3 -- More stable battery voltage display/alarms]* (optional)
Some models/batches of the '9X, especially when using batteries with higher internal resistance than the likes of Li-Ion cells (dry cells for example) tend to exhibit significantly erratic battery voltage sampling. An 'averaged over time' enhancement fixes this problem. See [VoltageAveraging Battery voltage averaging. Why, how and turning it off] for further details.

== Fr-Sky Telemetry Support ==

Following on from the beginnings of Fr-Sky/JETI support already included in ER9X, a little more progress is being made towards the goal of extensive support for Fr-Sky telemetry. So far (2010-11-30) this work (and other stuff too) is being done in an experimental code branch -- `.../svn/branches/usart2`

== RCModelReviews.com Telemetry Hub Support ==

Plans exist to support the [http://www.rcmodelreviews.com/frsky_telemetry_project.shtml RCModelReviews (RCMR) Telemetry Hub], once it is ready for public release. The basic goal here will be to duplicate the functions of the stand-alone 'dashboard' partner for the hub, inside the 9X, using it's own display, user interface, etc.


= Bigger Plans - A Whole New Main Board =

There are a number of somewhat challenging '9X hardware wiring modifications required just to get access to telemetry data. That alone is not too bad -- but we also want access to more of the IO pins currently (lazily) spread out over nearly all the higher function ports of the host ATmega64A chip. For example, access to MOSI/MISO/SCK (on Port B) for SPI mode data transfer to/from an MMC/SDCARD is desired for mass storage of telemetry and model data. 

These and other requirements led to a state of temporary insanity and the starting of a complete re-design of the entire main board PCB! 

Plans include a more powerful Atmel CPU to replace the ATmega64A, as well as break-outs for any and all I/O port pins that might be useful for future development -- including the CLK line for the event one ends up with a 'fuse bricked' controller. The heralded PB7 LCD back light interface will not be forgotten either. 

*Progress* towards this goal is being documented on the [Circuitry] wiki page. As of this writing, a PCB design closely replicating the stock design has been completed as a reference point. That design already includes an AVR SPI programming connector. The next step is to carry on from there, making more of the planned changes and additions.

= Contacting Gruvin =

Oh dear -- as of this writing, the Google Code system for obtaining owner email addresses is broken. Hopefully, Google will fix this very soon. Normally, you would visit my Google Projects user profile, then click the '...' in gru...@gmail.com to reveal the full address. On the other hand, if you're very clever, you might just be able to work that out for yourself. Hint: My user name is "gruvin", not "gru...". ;-)
