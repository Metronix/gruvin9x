= Introduction =

This project started out just as a kind of 'place holder' for the author's personal circuitry upgrades, hacks and mods to his [http://code.google.com/p/er9x/ ER9X]-powered Turnigy 9X V2 RC transmitter. As time marched on, more supporting documentation and other stuff got added. As of this writing (Oct 2011), there's a tonne of disorganised information on the site, which really could do with a complete re-design and re-write. But not yet -- too busy writing code and making boards! :P

= Project Detail =

(Somewhat historical now ...)

The initial main focus was around adding and enhancing Fr-Sky telemetry support and the development of an [PCB upgraded main logic board] -- for [Telemetry telemetry] support in general, as well as a better ATmega chip and MMC/SDCARD support for model data and general mass storage in FAT16/32 format.

Compatibility with the stock V2 '9X transmitter will be retained as far as possible. So fear not. There will "always" be a gruvin9x version available to run on the stock unit. There will also be different binary versions available to support the most common manual circuit hacks for telemetry (and other things) that do _not_ require the [PCB new PCB].

The first true stable, public release of gruvin9x was made in January, 2012. The release is code named, 'Frisky', is community verified 'stable' and thus believed to be essentially 'bug free'. (I hope I haven't jinxed anything by typing that! :-P)

Work continues for the next version, being mostly focussed on the new V4 custom controller board, though with improvements and added features also slated for the stock radio controller board.
