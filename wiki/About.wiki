= Introduction =

This project started out just as a kind of 'place holder' for the author's personal circuitry upgrades, hacks and mods to his [http://code.google.com/p/er9x/ ER9X]-powered Turnigy 9X V2 RC transmitter. As time marched on, more supporting documentation and other stuff got added. As of this writing (Oct 2011), there's a tonne of disorganised information on the site, which really could do with a complete re-design and re-write. But not yet -- too busy writing code and making boards! :P

= Project Detail =

(Somewhat historical now ...)

The initial main focus was around adding and enhancing Fr-Sky telemetry support and the development of an [PCB upgraded main logic board] -- for [Telemetry telemetry] support in general, as well as a better ATmega chip and MMC/SDCARD support for model data and general mass storage in FAT16/32 format.

Compatibility with the stock V2 '9X transmitter will be retained as far as possible. So fear not. There will "always" be a gruvin9x version available to run on the stock unit. There will also be different binary versions available to support the most common manual circuit hacks for telemetry (and other things) that do _not_ require the [PCB new PCB].

The first true stable, public release of gruvin9x was made in January, 2012. The release is code named, 'Frisky', is community verified 'stable' and thus believed to be essentially 'bug free'. (I hope I haven't jinxed anything by typing that! :-P)

Work continues for the next version, being mostly focussed on the new V4 custom controller board, though with improvements and added features also slated for the stock radio controller board.

== Beginnings ===
The project started off with a few relatively minor tweaks to ER9X, as it was back at ER9X revision 262.

Way back at gruvin9x revision 46 (r46), better key-repeat delays and the first circuit hack to get variable frequency tones through a speaker, instead of the single-pitch 'beeper' of the stock unit, were implemented.

The latter resulted in low/mid/higher pitch key and trim button beeps. But the long term intention for variable tone sounds was to provide a greater range of unique sounds for eyes-off telemetry communication. See [SpeakerReplacement Why I replaced the stock beeper with a speaker] for more on that.

Then, when I flashed the first local RC modeller's stock radio with gruvin9x, there were problems with the standard 8-pack of alkaline cells causing a _lot_ of jitter in the battery voltage display. Since then, gruvin9x has had a running-average stabiliser to fix that.

== Fr-Sky Telemetry Support ==

After a while, TH's original code started to becoming more and more clear. (Thomas is something of a genus C programmer IMHO too, by the way!) So I started delving more into menus, custom settings and the like, with support of Fr-Sky two-way telemetry in mind. See [FrSky here] for details of progress to date. Many changes have happened since then.

Things soon crossed that mysterious fine line between hobby and insanity, and designs for a whole new [PCB replacement/upgrade PCB] were started. Gruvin was hooked! :-D


== RCModelReviews.com Telemetry Hub Support ==

Plans exist to support the [http://www.rcmodelreviews.com/frsky_telemetry_project.shtml RCModelReviews (RCMR) Telemetry Hub], once it is ready for public release. The basic goal will be to duplicate the functions of the stand-alone 'dashboard' partner for the hub, inside the 9X, using its own LCD display, user interface, etc.


= Bigger Plans - A Whole New Main Board =

There are a number of somewhat challenging '9X hardware wiring modifications required just to get access to telemetry data. That alone is not too bad -- but we also want access to more of the IO pins currently (lazily) spread out over nearly all the higher function ports of the host ATmega64A chip. Most notably for the purposes of gruvin9x goals, dedicated access to MOSI/MISO/SCK (on Port B) for SPI mode data transfer to/from an MMC/SDCARD is needed.

These and other requirements led to a state of temporary insanity and the commencing of a complete re-work of the entire main board PCB! A near duplicate of the stock PCB was first worked up, then changes and additions were added. Find details on the [PCB] wiki page.

= Intended Features =
(*Telemetry* support was the primary inspiration for this project fork)
 * Ongoing Fr-Sky telemetry support extensions. ([http://code.google.com/p/gruvin9x/wiki/FrSky Now under well under way].)

 * On-board audible aircraft AoA (Angle of Attack) instrument support using Fr-Sky telemetry. (See [SpeakerReplacement Why I replaced the stock beeper with a speaker] for more detail.)

 * On-board audible [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variometer variometer] support, also using Fr-Sky telemetry.

 * Native 9X LCD/Sound emulation of [http://rcmodelreviews.com/ RCModelReviews] Telemetry Dashboard, to a lesser or greater extent depending on ... stuff ... (He hasn't released a final working version yet.)

 * Addition of _MMC/SDCARD_ socket to facilitate bulk storage of system settings, model programming and telemetry data -- in addition to or separate from existing EEPROM storage. (This will likely now only be supported on the upgrade PCB, due to limited program space for implementing convenient DOS/FAT32 file system abilities.)

 * Some kind of audio file playback for alarms, telemetry "voice" and so forth. (Many options to choose from, including MP3 playback from MMC card for example. R&D continues.)

 * Ongoing development of a complete replacement PCB for '9X radio to give more program pace, MMC/SDCARD interface and more. See the [Circuitry] wiki page.

 * Support for other telemetry systems (ex. JETI)
