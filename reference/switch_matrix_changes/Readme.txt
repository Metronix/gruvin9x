Historical information for v2.14 and v3.2 board only ...

These images show the mods needed for correct operation of the new switch matrix implemented from V2.14 and v3.2 of the Gruvin PCB. The use of the 100-pin ATmega2560 in the v4.1+ boards means we no longer need this "key scan" wiring change to be made.

First you need to cut some traces. The boards you need to alter are the horizontal trim boards. Both sides of both boards need altering. The red rings in the images show you where.

After that you need to add a couple of wires from these boards to the vertical trim boards, again shown in a photo.

You may notice my TX has different connectors and on different sides of the boards. This is simply because I don't
like the standard permanently connected headers, so I changed them to JST-PH connectors like the rest of the TX, much 
better.
