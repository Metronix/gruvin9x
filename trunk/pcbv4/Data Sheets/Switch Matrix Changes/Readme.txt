These images show the mods needed for correct operation of the new switch matrix implemented 
from V2.14 of the Gruvin PCB upward.

First you need to cut some traces. The boards you need to alter are the horizontal trim boards. Both 
sides of both boards need altering. The red rings in the images show you where.

After that you need to add a couple of wires from these boards to the vertical trim boards, again shown in a photo.

You may notice my TX has different connectors and on different sides of the boards. This is simply because I don't
like the standard permanently connected headers, so I changed them to JST-PH connectors like the rest of the TX, much 
better.
